Standardized interfaces allow applications to be seamlessly migrated or operated across different environments. For Cloud Service Providers, open standards enable compatibility and the creation of a network of federated cloud infrastructures, as advocated by the German Administrative Cloud Strategy. Users retain control over their data and can switch providers without vendor lock-in. Open standards thus promote digital sovereignty and provide the ideal foundation for successful digitalization in both the public and private sectors.","text":null,"button":null,"boxes":null,"personas":null},{"headline1":"SCS Standards â€¦","headline2":null,"text1":null,"text":null,"button":null,"boxes":[{"title":"... from the Community","text":"Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a community-driven open-source project that unites standards like OpenInfra interoperability guidelines and CNCF Kubernetes conformity."},{"title":"... in the Reference Implementation","text":"The modular and federable SCS open-source reference implementation automatically integrates all developed standards for IaaS and KaaS across various providers and data centers."},{"title":"... in Collaboration","text":"In 2023, a collaboration with the ALASCA association was initiated to advance open cloud standards.
